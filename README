		 6translator - An adapter for IPv4-only daemons on IPv6 servers
================================================================================

6translator opens up your IPv4 only daemons to the IPv4 world.  It listens for
connections on IPv6, creates connections over IPv4, and shuffles data between
them.  That's it!

Installation
------------

$ make
$ make install

The default prefix is /usr.  Use PREFIX= to override it.

Usage
-----

$ 6translator -6 [hostname,]port -4 [hostname,]port [-f]

-6 <ipv6 host>,<ipv6 port>  Specifies the (IPv6) host and port to listen on.
-4 <ipv4 host>,<ipv4 port>  Specifies the (IPv4) host and port to connect to.
-f Stay in foreground (handy for debugging).

-6 and -4 must specify at least a port.  If no hostnames are specified, it
listens on any (IPv6) address and connects to localhost.

If -f is specified, 6translator runs in the foreground and logs to stderr.
Otherwise, it daemonizes and logs to syslog.

Example
-------

To allow IPv6 clients to connect to your IPv4 IRC server on port 6668, use:

$ 6translator -6 6668 -4 6667

If your ircd only listens on the IPv4 addresses, you can use the same port by
specifying the IPv6 address to listen on:

$ 6translator -6 host6name,6667 -4 6667

If you want to forward IPv6 connections to an IPv4 daemon on another server, you
can specify the IPv4 hostname:

$ 6translator -6 6667 -4 irc.example.org,6667
